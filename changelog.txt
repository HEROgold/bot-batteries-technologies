Version: 3.1.1
Date: 2024-12-25
  Notes:
    - To properly fix the updating and tracking, use the new command to reset tracked roboports.
      This will allow new roboports to be updated automatically, as they should.
      Use the upgrade tool for existing roboports, or research a technology to start upgrading again.
  Added:
    - Command to clean internally tracked roboports. '/br-clean'
  Fixes:
    - Fixed that upgrading roboports didn't reset the internal tracking.
