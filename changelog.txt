Version: 2.0.3
Date: 2024-09-03
  Fixes:
    - Fixed a bug wehn destrucing a logistic it gave back the vanilla version. (losing you resources)
    - Fixed a bug when placing upgrade roboport ghosts causing a crash.
    - Fixed a bug when a ghost would **not** be reverted to a vanilla roboport.

    - When using any upgraded ghost, it upgrades/reverts to whatever research level you have.
      If you want to use editor to place a upgraded roboport, place the actual roboport, not a ghost.

Version: 2.0.1
Date: 2024-08-25
  Fixes:
    - Fixed a bug when robots build a roboport.
  Info:
    - I've done some testing with increasing the limits of upgrades, but it seems to be a bit too much for the game to handle.
      It'll be kept at 9, as that seems to be a safe limit.
