## TODO:

Use productivity module for upgrade levels on cargo capacity
Use speed module for upgrade levels on speed
Use efficienty module for upgrade levels on battery

Use quality module for upgrade levels on to unlock a bot, that can both construct and do logistics.
(This needs some scripting to swap between constrution and logistic bot prototypes :( )
